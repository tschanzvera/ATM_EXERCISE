Simple React ATM

## DESCRIPTION

This was a little project that I had in my MITxPRO course. The exercise was to refactor an ATM project. In this project you can add or withdraw money to and from the account depending on which button you click. I added validation so it is not possible to withdraw more money then there is on the account. If there is an insufficient amount of funds an alert box pops up.
